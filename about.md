I started my career as a power engineer, speacializing in renewable energy development and economic forecasting. Since that time, I have worked as a lead data scientist and software engineer, specializing in Bayesian models, machine learning, and statistical methods in general. Currently I work as an Applied Scientist, where I contribute to supply chain optimization and demand forecasts.

During my career, I have developed dozens of machine learning and deep learning models from prototype to production. I have experience managing professional software teams, and architecting enterprise-scale data science / machine learning platforms for widespread use. I enjoy learning new ideas in data science and computer science, and this blog is an attempt to reinforce these ideas. Hopefully you enjoy it!
