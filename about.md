I started my career as a power engineer, speacializing in renewable energy development and economic forecasting. Since that time, I have worked as a lead data scientist and software engineer, specializing in developing Bayesian models and downstream statistical metrics at scale. Currently I work as an Applied Scientist, where I contribute to supply chain optimization and demand forecasts.

During my career, I have developed dozens of machine learning and deep learning models from prototype to production. I have experience managing professional software development teams via Agile, and architecting enterprise-scale data science / machine learning platforms on AWS. I enjoy implementing robust scalable algorithms that can process TBs of batch data or analyze streaming data in real time.
